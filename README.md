# Description
This is for fun, practicing how to make the express server more organized.



## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
1. `cd` into the newly created directory.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm run dev`. This command will spin up a server on port 5000 that will automatically restart when changes are made to source files.

When you navigate to `localhost:5000` initially, you should see a `Not found: /` message in the browser because none of the routes have been implemented yet.
